[Research team sets new mark for 'deep learning'](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161216115448.htm)
  * semisupervised learning
  * learning MNIST from 10 labelled samples (each for digit)
  * convnet (nonlinear process)
    * 1st layer: edges, color changes
    * 2nd layer: complex patterns on 1st output
  * visual cortex
  * human inspired (babies are not showed thousands of samples, but rather few)
  * interaction with the world shaping the brain/deepnet (each convnet may start the same, but may learn different things)
  * edges are very important for digit recognition (many lower layers become edge detectors)
  * possible applications where we are unable to label the whole set (e.g. recognizing images in video)
  * 2-way learning (AI - further the knowledge about brain, neuroscience - new ideas for AI)
  * also import differences between brain and convents
  * brain learns mostly unsupervised
  * elucidate - make something clear; explain
  * RiceU news on the same topic: http://news.rice.edu/2016/12/16/rice-baylor-team-sets-new-mark-for-deep-learning-2/
  * SD: does obscure the use of MNISP dataset
  * SD: very similar to RiceU news
  * RU: nested method of looking for patterns within patterns (within patterns) is referred to as a nonlinear process
  * convnet - very basic visual cortex
  * each self-driving car uses convnet as they are best for vision at the moment
  * SD: much more emotional than the original news
  * RU current news, unfortunately no category for AI: http://news.rice.edu/category/current-news/
  
[Lynx gives Amazon's Alexa appendages, personality, and robot dance moves](http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/ubtech-lynx-ces-2017/)
  * built on top of Alexa Voice Service
  * interesting: usage of big company AI services with company customizations
  * interesting: building interactive robot assistant
  * DigitalTrends - accurate (Alexa based, the title, etc.), no emotional sugar coating

[Obama administration report warns 47 percent of jobs at risk of AI takeover](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/report-ai-jobs-at-risk/)
  * low-skilled, repetitive jobs at highest risk - waiting stuff, driving
  * spread overtime, 9% over next 20 years
  * different from previous change as replaced people won't become operators (but, some could become robot trainers / supervisors?)
  
[Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg pulls back the veil on the Jarvis ai system he created](http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/mark-zuckerberg-gives-update-on-jarvis-ai-system/)
  * biggest problem - interfacing all APIs that they could talk to each other (in some cases RE required)
  * grey t-shirt cannon
  * messenger chat-bot
  * text feature very important
  * Mark uses text much more frequently than speech because
    * it feels more natural if it is his personal request, and not for ee

    * may communicate with home system outside of the home
  * not perfect (4 attempts to switch off lights xD?)
  * lift (pull) the veil - to make something known that was secret before

[Amazon raises the stakes, will equip all rooms at the Wynn in Vegas with an Echo](http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/the-wynn-in-las-vegas-to-put-amazon-echos-in-rooms/)
  * improved guest experience - everything controlled with voice (curtains, lights, TV, temperature, etc.)
  * 4,748 rooms in total
