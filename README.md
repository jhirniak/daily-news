I like to read every day news around different topics. This is a digest of websites I look up for each of the specific topics. The list is iterative learning in what is a good reading list for a particular topicthat fits within 30-45 minutes.

This is my private news reading list, hosted on GitHub for convenience, and shared, in a case, someone would find it useful. Please, feel free to fork ;).
